# REST overview

A REST API is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. You can use REST API to execute HTTP methods on a REST API service endpoint.

Select a pre-configured REST account from the dropdown or click **Add Account** to configure your existing REST account.

* In **Service URL**, enter the service endpoint URL of REST API.
* Use the **Filter Data** option to filter the incoming data uploaded by the source endpoint. Once a filter is applied, you can view it in the **Data Wrangler** and further edit the filter condition.
* Click **Save and Continue**.
