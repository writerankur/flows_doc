# Salesforce Write Settings

Salesforce Sales Cloud is a leading customer relationship management \(CRM\) application for customer service and support. 

Flows enables you to connect your Salesforce account to:

* Create, update, or delete objects in Salesforce.
* Download an attachment from a record.
* Read, look up, or query records.
* Poll the status of a batch job.

To begin your Salesforce Flows, either select a pre-configured Salesforce account from the dropdown or click **Add Account** to configure your existing Salesforce account.
