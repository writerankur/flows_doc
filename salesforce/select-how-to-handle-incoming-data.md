To begin your Salesforce Flows, either select whether you want to create a scheduled Flow or set up an external event using Webhook.

**Schedule Flow:** Create a scheduled Flow between a source and target endpoint.

**Webhook:** Set up an external event with your Salesforce developer account. A notification will be sent to SnapLogic when the event occurs.
